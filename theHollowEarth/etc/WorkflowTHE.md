# Workflow file for The Hollow Earth 

1. Set up directory structure

2. Demo Base Script for piano iterations

3. Work out "Red" dynamic layers 

4. Demo "Red" script for all instruments

5. Write Full "Red" Scripts for all instruments

6. Copy generated Lilypond Music expressions to %instrument%.ly files

7. Demo score

8. Repeat for "Green"+"Blue"


## To Demo Base Script

1. Generate rhythmic basis

2. Plot iteration path through pitch field

3. Define pitch field and iteration path in Python module

4. Run Module 

5. Copy output (lilypond music expression) to %instrument%.ly file

6. Compile score


## General Remarks on Musical Structure // Orchestral Colors 
### Red + Blue
   - Basis of these parts are the 'bouncing rhythms' rhythms for piano, 
     vibraphone and by extension, flute. Soft, long ringing tones 
     on the vibes and piano that are being "shadowed" by a quarter 
     tone pitch bend on the flue.
